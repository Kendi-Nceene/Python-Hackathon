# 7. Calories from Fat and Carbohydrates
# A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by
# evaluating their diets.  As part of her evaluation, she asks
# members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams
# that they consumed in a day.  Then, she calculates the number
# of calories that result from the fat, using the following
# formula:
#   calories from fat = fat grams X 9
# Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from
# the carbohydrates, using the following formula:
#   calories from carbs = carb grams X 4
# The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make
# these calculations.
